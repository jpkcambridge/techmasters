        </ul>
        <p><big><strong>How much does it cost to join?</strong></big><br>
          The cost is calcuated for each semester, depening on the number of workouts
          and number of people swimming. Everyone who swims with Tech Masters swimming
          must have an active athletic card. Go to the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/athcards98.html">athletic
          page</a> for details about that. The Tech masters swimming fee covers the coache/lane rental
          fee only.</p>
        <p> <big><strong>Do you have a coach? </strong></big>
        <p>All of the scheduled workouts do have a coach
        <p><big><strong>How long is the pool?Is it meters or yards?</strong></big>
        <p>The pool is generally set up as a 25 yard pool except for January and May to mid August when it is set up as a 50 M pool.</p><br>

        <big><strong>I used to swim alot but haven't been in a pool in ages. Can I
        join?</strong></big><br>
        While we at MIT Masters don't compete as a group, we do have swimmers in
        our group who compete on their own. However, many of our group swim for
        fun and fitness.
        <br>
          The minimum requirements exist for our group (they may be waived with good cause,
          <a href="mailto:patti@mit.edu">contact Patti</a> for more information):<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Have working knowledge of all four strokes (freestyle, backstroke, butterfly
            and breaststroke)
          <li>Be able to swim 500 yards without stopping
          <li>Know what interval you would do 100 yard sets.
        </ul>
        <p> You should feel comfortable with timing yourself on a pace clock (we can teach
          you this if this is all you're missing).
        <p><p>
        <big><strong>Do you have a waiting list?</strong></big><br>
          We do not currently have a waiting list.
        <p> <big><strong>Where else in the Boston area can I swim?</strong></big><br>
